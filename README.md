# probability_distribution_fitting_power_load_profile
It contains a python (jupyter) implementation solving the problem of fitting a dataset to the optimal probability distribution from a set of probability distributions. The dataset consists of power load profiles and is a small one and intended only for demostration purposes, it contains just a few load profile curves from residential users in Medell√≠n, Colombia. At the end, several load profile curves based on the optimal distribution are generated and an average curve (the centroid) is found along with its load factor.
